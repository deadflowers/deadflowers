Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled

He soon lost all control

Over everything which he had made

While the mission bells did toll

He just stood there staring

At that big house as bright as any sun

With four and twenty windows

And a woman‚Äôs face in every one



Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee

With a soulful, bounding leap

And, foaming at the mouth

He began to make his midnight creep

For sixteen nights and days he raved

But on the seventeenth he burst

Into the arms of Judas Priest

Which is where he died of thirst



No one tried to say a thing

When they took him out in jest

Except, of course, the little neighbor boy

Who carried him to rest

And he just walked along, alone

With his guilt so well concealed

And muttered underneath his breath

‚ÄúNothing is revealed‚Äù
